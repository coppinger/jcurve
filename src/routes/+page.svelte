			I decided to work on reimagining the creator profile pages. With the basis of a block system
			in place, and the ability to add a custom domain, it felt like there was an obvious next step
			to flesh it out.
			<br />

			My reasoning here is that an improved profile would directly increase GMV, by both increasing the
			conversion rate (thus, volume of transactions), as well as the AOV through greater exposure of

					At first, I spent a good chunk of time trying to split my efforts between building out the
					new creator pages, as well as a new product creation flow
					<br />
					<br />
					In retrospect, I should have focused solely on the latter, which became clear to me once I
					heard â€˜the website builder is our north starâ€™ in the uncensored (ðŸ¥µ) board meeting video.

					Given the intensity of the work I tried to rapidly produce, I sacrificed a certain degree
					of organization within the file itself.
					<br />
					<br />
					Predictably, this correlated with an increased frequency of scrambling for components and styles,
					but given a less volatile schedule and pace, I am far more diligent with organization.

					Ultimately, I tried to cover a lot of ground, and in doing so there were elements and
					components that I had to press on with, despite not being completely satisfied with them.
					<br />
					<br />
					This is a natural part of the design process, given there are always time and resource constraints,
					but was somewhat of a reflection of the intensity of the sprint.
